<h1>SOC Automation Tool</h1>

<p>Welcome to the SOC Automation Tool project! This tool integrates Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to create a powerful Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution. Designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of your Security Operations Center (SOC), this tool aims to automate incident detection, analysis, and response workflows.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wazuh Integration:</strong> Utilize Wazuh for comprehensive security monitoring, log analysis, and intrusion detection.</li>
  <li><strong>TheHive Integration:</strong> Leverage TheHive for efficient incident management, case creation, and collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>Shuffle as SOAR:</strong> Automate your incident response workflows with Shuffle, creating seamless interactions between Wazuh, TheHive, and other security tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Live Monitoring with Wazuh:</strong> Real-time monitoring and alerting for security events, allowing for immediate detection and response to incidents.</li>
  <li><strong>Email Alerts:</strong> Automatically send email notifications to SOC admins when alerts are detected using Shuffle automation.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Dashboards:</strong> Create custom dashboards to visualize security data and metrics, making it easier to monitor the health and status of your SOC.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Reporting:</strong> Generate automated reports on security incidents, trends, and SOC performance metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Efficiency:</strong> Automate repetitive tasks to free up your SOC analysts for more critical work.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Response Time:</strong> Quickly detect and respond to security incidents with automated workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily scale your SOC operations with flexible and customizable automation.</li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive Visibility:</strong> Gain a complete view of your security posture with integrated monitoring and incident management.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Manual Effort:</strong> Minimize manual intervention with automated processes and workflows.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Working</h2>
<p>The SOC Automation Tool works through a series of interconnected steps to provide comprehensive security monitoring and response:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Event Detection:</strong> Wazuh continuously monitors system logs and network traffic for security events and anomalies.</li>
  <li><strong>Alert Generation:</strong> When Wazuh detects a potential security incident, it generates an alert and sends it to TheHive.</li>
  <li><strong>Incident Management:</strong> TheHive receives the alert, creates a case, and facilitates collaboration among SOC analysts to investigate and respond to the incident.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation with Shuffle:</strong> Shuffle automates the incident response workflow by integrating actions between Wazuh and TheHive. This can include triggering additional scans, updating case statuses, and notifying relevant personnel.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts:</strong> Throughout the process, live monitoring and email alerts keep SOC admins informed of the incident's status and any critical updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting and Analysis:</strong> Finally, automated reports are generated to provide insights into the incident, response actions taken, and overall SOC performance, helping to improve future security operations.</li>
</ol>
